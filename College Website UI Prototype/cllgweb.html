            <p>As a BTech cse student, I found the college fascinating . The classes were divided into different sections where each section has 72 students due to which the faculty give attention to all the students. the facilities were well trained and they were up to date with the new technologies and give proper teaching to all the students. talking about the term exams, all the term exams were held on time as mentioned in the academic calendar and the question level was set as per the UGC guidelines.</p>
